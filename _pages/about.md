About Me [(CV)](files/CV.pdf)
===
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering PhD Student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) working with Professors [Jenna Wiens](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/) and [David Fouhey](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fouhey/). My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision, with applications in healthcare. 

I did my undergrad at the University of Michigan, where I received my BSE in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and my BBA from the [Ross School of Business](https://michiganross.umich.edu/).

**Deep Learning Applied to Chest X-rays: Exploiting and Preventing Shortcuts** 

Recently, deep learning has made significant improvements in automating the diagnosis of disease from chest X-rays. However, these models are easily susceptible to the use of features that do not directly cause disease, but rather are correlated with disease in the training population. Since these features may not transfer across populations, we developed an approach to encourage models to use *clinically relevant* features in the data.
