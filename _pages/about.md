My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision, with applications in healthcare. 

I did my undergrad at the University of Michigan, where I received my BSE in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and my BBA from the [Ross School of Business](https://michiganross.umich.edu/).
